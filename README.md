# Attendance System using Facial Recognition

## Overview
This project is a facial recognition-based attendance system developed as part of my final year engineering project. It automates the attendance process using real-time face detection and recognition, reducing the chances of proxy attendance.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Auto-marking of attendance with date and time
- Student face registration system
- Attendance report generation
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Microsoft Excel 2016(for database)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
